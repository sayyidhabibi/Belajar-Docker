# 🚀 Docker Study Case Roadmap  
From Intermediate → Advanced → Hard → Very Hard

This study case roadmap is designed to progressively build Docker expertise from intermediate-level container usage to production-grade DevOps architecture.

Each level introduces new real-world challenges, architectural complexity, and best practices used in modern backend systems.

---

# 🟡 Level 1 — Intermediate

## Objective
Understand how multi-container applications work and how services communicate inside Docker.

## Focus Areas
- Writing Dockerfiles for application services
- Using Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple containers
- Creating custom Docker networks
- Reverse proxy configuration
- Port mapping and service exposure

## What You Learn
At this level, you move beyond single-container applications and start understanding service-to-service communication, internal DNS resolution, and how Docker networking actually works.

By the end of this level, you should be comfortable running multi-service applications locally using Docker Compose.

---

# 🟠 Level 2 — Advanced

## Objective
Optimize and secure containers for production-like environments.

## Focus Areas
- Multi-stage builds
- Image size optimization
- Running containers as non-root user
- Environment variable management
- Volume persistence
- Health checks
- Network segmentation (frontend/backend separation)

## What You Learn
You begin thinking like a backend engineer preparing applications for staging or production environments.  

This level emphasizes performance, security, and container lifecycle management.

By the end of this level, your containers should be smaller, safer, and better structured.

---

# 🔴 Level 3 — Hard

## Objective
Build a microservices-based architecture with scaling and state management.

## Focus Areas
- Multiple backend services
- Load balancing
- Database container integration
- Caching system (Redis)
- Horizontal scaling
- Stateless vs stateful architecture

## What You Learn
You transition from simple containerization to distributed systems thinking.

This level introduces:
- Service discovery
- Scaling strategies
- Persistent storage design
- Application performance improvement

By the end of this level, you should understand how modern backend systems are structured using containers.

---

# ⚫ Level 4 — Very Hard

## Objective
Simulate real-world production infrastructure and DevOps workflow.

## Focus Areas
- CI/CD automation
- Private container registry
- HTTPS and SSL termination
- Monitoring and observability
- Logging systems
- Docker secrets management
- Resource limits and performance control

## What You Learn
At this level, you are no longer just a developer — you are thinking like a DevOps engineer.

You will understand:
- How production systems are deployed
- How to monitor containerized applications
- How to secure sensitive data
- How to manage infrastructure reliability
- How to automate deployments

By the end of this level, you should be capable of designing production-ready container architectures confidently.

---

# 🎯 Final Goal

After completing all levels, you should:

- Understand Docker deeply (not just commands)
- Be able to design scalable architectures
- Optimize and secure container environments
- Debug networking and performance issues
- Deploy containerized applications in real-world scenarios
